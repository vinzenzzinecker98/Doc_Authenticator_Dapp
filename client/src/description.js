      <p><h3>This website is an access-point to a local Ethereum blockchain and can be used to authenticate the integrity of documents.</h3></p>
      <p><h4>There are two main features:</h4> (1) You can Register Documents to the ledger<br></br>(2) You can verify Documents (see whether they have been
       registered, and by whom.)
        <p className="text-muted">For the registration feature (1) you need to be signed in to your Ethereum Account, using the MetaMask Plug-In 
        (obtainable from <a href="https://metamask.io/">here</a>).<br></br> 
        The verification feature (2) is usable without login and without Metamask.</p>
        <p>
          <h4>For each feature there are two approaches:</h4> <p> 
            You can either use the file selection function which lets you conveniently select the document you want to register/validate: 
            <br></br>- File-type and extension of the file is irrelevant, only the filesize may not exceed
          your browsers maximum local cache (which is typically 265 MB).)<br></br>
          - The file is then hashed on your local machine and only the SHA-265 value is registered to the blockchain.</p>
          <p>
            Secondly, if you dont trust the service, you can also generate the SHA-256 value yourself (For Windows: run "CertUtil -hashfile C:\\path\to\file.xyz SHA256") and provide the hash value.
            In case you want to use another hash-function, you can also do that but note that in this case you cannot use the file-select feature for
            validation, and you have to tell the people you provide with the document, which hash function they have to use.
          </p>
          <h4>Ether prices:</h4>
          <p>Registering a documement comes with a gas fee averaging 0.00075 Ether, which is about 15 Cent (given 1 Ether = 200â‚¬). The nature of the service allows the validation to be free of charge, 
            because it does not alter the state of the blockchain (contract call), so you only have to pay Ether once - when registering a new document and it can be validated 
            for free.

      <Card.Body style={{"text-align": "left"}}><h3>Frameworks:</h3>
      We use the <a href="">trufflesuite framework </a>, which provides the local blockchain (ganache/ truffle develop) aswell as the tool to access the blockchain, drizzle. Drizzle 
      synchronizes the state of the blockchain with a redux store which is accessed by the frontend (running with react). We use facebook's react-scripts, as it provides a 
      usable testing environment and is simple to setup.
